# Nazari Problem Generation and Evaluation

This folder contains scripts to generate CVRP problem instances following the method described by Nazari et al. and to evaluate them using OR-Tools.

## Scripts

### `generate_nazari_pb.py`

This script generates a dataset of CVRP instances.

- **Output**: Multiple `.pt` (PyTorch) file containing 10,000 problem instances each.


### `eval_or_tools.py`

This script solves the generated instances using Google OR-Tools to establish a baseline.

- **Input**: Takes a size (e.g. 100) and search a file generated by the previous script and a maximum time limit per instance.
- **Output**: Creates a `.csv` file storing the results of the evaluation.

## Usage

1. **Generate Data**:
    ```bash
    uv run generate_nazari_pb.py
    ```

2. **Evaluate with OR-Tools**:
    ```bash
    uv run eval_or_tools.py --dim 100 --time 0.5
    ```
